# Summary


# Statement of need

`bibfix` is an R package and Shiny App that helps users repair and enrich their bibloigraphic data (.RIS files). It does so through a suite of functions that request bibliographic data from API services including CrossRef, The Lens.org and OpenAlex. Repaired fields can include titles, abstract, unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs), publication years, etc.

In addition, bibliographic records can be supplemented with additional  information, including internal identifiers for common databases (e.g. The Lens.org, PubMed, Microsoft Academic) that facilitate deduplication, and information such as author affiliations and identifiers (e.g. ORCIDs).


`bibfix` is designed to be used by researchers conducting bibliographic analysis and systematic evidence synthesis.
